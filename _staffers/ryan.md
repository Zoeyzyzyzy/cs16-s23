Hello everyone! My name is Ryan He and I am a 2nd year undergrad student. I am currently a part of the Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP) where I am currently working with Prof. William Wang.
Outside of school, I like to cook, play video games, go to the gym, and playing tennis. 
If you have any question, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or any of the other staff via Piazza or office hours!
