Hi everyone, welcome to CS16! I hope we have an amazing quarter!!
 
My name is Bryan Zamora, a 4th year undergraduate student. I enjoy teaching, I hope I can teach as a hobby in the future. I had previously been a Learning Assistant (LA) for CS 32, 16, 156. I Was part of the Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP) Where I did research on Computer Vision under the supervision of Professor Tobias Höllerer. One of the projects my team and I worked on was a Flask web app which classifies a picture to have an indoor(e.g. Inside a house) or outdoor scene(e.g. A forest). I am also part of the Undergraduate Affairs Committee.
 
In the future, I would like to work at some tech company to obtain industry experience. Then work with my friends to create our own tech company. BryIan would like to donate revenue from the company to non profit organizations that teach computer science because I believe computer science education should be accessible to more people.
 
On my free time, I like to work out, cook, bake (I really like making Flan), play video games, working on side projects (Currently working on a React Native app)
 
I also have interest in web and app development because I think we can use these tools to solve many problems around the world. I previously instructed an intro to web development in English and Spanish to high school students ( HTML, CSS, Javascript). Over a summer I taught web and mobile development to high school students where they developed apps from idea to Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Using the MEAN Stack and Ionic.
 
 
I hope to see many of you all during office hours! Do not hesitate to ask any questions in regards to the class or any other area of interest.
 
If you ever have any questions do not hesitate to reach out to any of our fellow staff members, we all are here to support you and help you make this experience as best as possible!
