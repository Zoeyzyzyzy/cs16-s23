Greetings, welcome to CS16! My name is Arjun Prakash and I am a second-year Masters student. I am currently with the DSL lab, where I am working on a project involving cross-chain atomic transactions in decentralized networks. In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton and watching movies. If you have any questions or would like to chat about anything, don't hesitate to reach out to me. I am looking forward to meeting you all and having a great quarter together.
