Hello everyone! My name is Vinothini, you can call me as Vino. I’m a second year Masters student in CS department. Before joining Master’s program at UCSB, I was working as a software developer in a cloud based software company for 4+ years. Currently, I’m working in MOMENT Lab with Prof.Elizabeth Belding.

If you have any questions about coursework or if you need help in programming in general, don’t hesitate to reach me out via Piazza or Email. I would be happy to help you along.
